## Project Report
The most interesting thing I found about this assignment was figuring out how to structure the entire project. Making sure certain nodes were able to access one another, and which to make parents or child of each other was a useful challenge that helped me learn how to do this for more complex features in the future. This is also a good test for all applications of object-oriented programming in the future.  
- [X] D-1: The repository link is submitted before the project deadline.
- [X] D-2: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file that includes the project identifier and author's name.
- [X] D-3: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
- [X] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file and no unnecessary files tracked.
- [X] C-2: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [X] C-3: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of T or less.
- [X] C-4: The player can control the angle at which the projectile is fired.
- [X] C-5: The player can fire the projectile.
- [X] C-6: The projectile's flight is affected by gravity using Godot Engine's physics system.
- [X] C-7: There is a &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that stops the projectile.
- [X] C-8: There is a non-ground target that the projectile can hit.
- [ ] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration as well as the reflections from previous iterations, if any.
- [ ] B-2: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a self-assessment.
- [ ] B-3: The release is published to GitHub Pages with a link provided in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [X] B-4: The projectile's firing angle is clamped between 0&deg; (straight forward) and 90&deg; (straight up).
- [X] B-5: Once fired, the projectile is non-interactive.
- [X] A-1: The player can modify the strength of the projectile's firing.
- [X] A-2: There is a visual indicator showing the angle at which the projectile will fire.
- [X] A-3: The projectile's hitting the target is recognized and logged to the console or otherwise indicated.
Based off of all of the completed requirements, I have earned an A for Project 1, Iteration 1.
